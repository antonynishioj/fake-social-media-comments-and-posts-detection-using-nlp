# fake-social-media-comments-and-posts-detection-using-nlp
This project develops a fake news detection system utilizing Natural Language Processing and machine learning. It classifies social media posts as "true" or "false" based on similarity to incident descriptions and detects contradictions, addressing the challenges of misinformation on social media platforms.


# Fake News Detection System

This project implements a fake news detection system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify social media posts related to real incidents. By analyzing posts for similarity to an incident description and checking for contradictions, the system aims to provide a reliable automated solution for identifying misinformation.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes input text by removing URLs and special characters.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into a numerical format for analysis.
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Measures similarity between the incident description and social media posts.
- **Contradiction Detection**: Flags posts containing specific phrases that imply contradictions or misinformation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for inputting incident descriptions and social media posts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementation.
- **scikit-learn**: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Regular Expressions**: For text preprocessing tasks.
